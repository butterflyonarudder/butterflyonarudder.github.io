      So I'm starting this blog thing. Things are taking an incredible
      shape in my life and part of my new vocabulary has been the phrase
      Open Source.

      I have understood this to live mostly in design ideas in a very
      linear- computer program or physical invention- type setting. My
      fella gave me a new meaning this morning. We are in constant
      dialog about supporting ourselves sustainably, during part of
      that dialog this morning, he asked me to open source my life to
      the Universe, or at least that part of the universe reachable by
      internet.
