      So I'm starting this blog thing. Things are taking an incredible
      shape in my life and part of my new vocabulary has been the phrase
      Open Source.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have understood this to live mostly in design ideas in a very
      linear- computer program or physical invention- type setting. My
      fella gave me a new meaning this morning. We are in constant
      dialog about supporting ourselves sustainably, during part of
      that dialog this morning, he asked me to open source my life to
      the Universe, or at least that part of the universe reachable by
      internet.

      "Eileen, please write."

      Um. Dear lad, you know not what you ask. "Find me time," I said. I
      went to a programmers' meeting with him, crawled into my headphones
      and began.

      In the Beginning, I became a single mom with three damaged,
      middle-sized boys. I worked part time at a fabrics and crafts
      store, learned to teach knitting and crocheting, sewing, playing
      with papaer and beads and wire, and finally, cake decorating. I
      had a group of fabulous women who stayed with me for 3
      months. They allowed me to learn the material for the second and
      third courses as I was teaching them. I am indebted. Especially to
      one who was in a similar family situation and the same age, within
      months of me, actually. She was also in the Nursing Program at our
      community college. Several months before, I had realized that I
      was practicing (habitually) as a mental health therapist at just
      above minimum wage. Now I realized that School was an option. In
      order to do what I wanted, get paid an equitable wage for using
      the gifts that I enjoy using; to obtain a license as a mental
      health counselor, I needed a Master's degree in clinical
      psychology.

      I'm four semesters in. I love it. My life has continued to shift
      as I continue to awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I began a project for a local hotel, hemming half their
      draperies to accomodate new ac units. I'm charging $20/hour. This
      opportunity came from a friend of a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I also obtained certification for my yard as Wildlife
      Habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have Oyster Mushrooms growing both in my yard and in containers
      in my house. I save my coffee grounds and stuff them back in their
      bags, after inoculating them with spawn, poke holes in the bag,
      put it in a plastic salad box (the kind that salad comes in at the
      grocers, or a plastic cake box from the grocery bakery). In the
      yard, the grounds are rolled into a pizza box, like a big jelly
      roll. I have also slurry-planted Shaggy Mane and Shaggy Parasol
      that I've gathered locally, and some Agaricus variety (given to my
      fella by a local Mushroom expert) in compost and stick piles
      around my yard. I worked my tail feathers off last Summer for some
      guys with a tree nursery and earned some serious trees. Sweet
      Cherry, Liberty Apple, Comice Pear, Seckle Pear, 3 yellow Plums;
      these will all have fruit next season. I also got some younger nut
      trees; Hazels and a Chinese Chestnut, a bunch of Currant shoots, a
      dozen or so juvenile Grape vines, as well as a couple of
      Blackberries, handful of BlackCap Raspberries, Chokecherry and
      native Plum shoots, a Saskatoon, Strawberries, a pair of Highbush
      Cranberries, and a pair of Sea Buckthorns. (I warned my landlord
      when I moved in that I have a habit of planting things, he said,
      'go for it.')
    </p>
    <p>
      I also make things for sale, but don't have the patience for craft
      fairs or farmer's markets. I set up a website, but then let the
      fee for the builder I used slide and now my page says something
      like, "under construction". Would like to get that up and running
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes. I'll be 43 this Summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you, Bridget the Writing Pixie!
